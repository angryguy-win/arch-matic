# Arch install Script
## This is still in development work in progress.
## need more live install testing.
## still ironning out the kinks and making sure it works for all cases.

run the install script ` bash install.sh `
The script is broken down into 6 parts
1. Pre             Install
2. Drives
3. Base            install and system
4. Post            install
5. Desktop
6. Final           clean up
7. post-setup

For example it could be used whit somthing like this:
( https://github.com/angryguy-win/Rust-Arch-menu )
arch_config.toml
Key = Varible pair list is used for the install.
Or it could just be edited manualy for use with other scripts.

## Program functions/Modules

DRY_RUN is a true/false variable that is used to enable or disable dry run mode.
When set to true, the script will not execute any commands and will only print 
the commands that would have been executed.
```bash
-v --verbose
-d --dry-run


sudo bash install.sh --dry-run
# Example output
[INFO] Starting stage:  1-pre
[INFO] Executing:  1-pre/pre-setup.sh
[ACTION] - Would execute: bash /home/ssnow/projects/arch-install/scripts/1-pre/pre-setup.sh   (Script: pre-setup.sh)
```
DEBUG_MODE is a true/false variable that is used to enable or disable debug mode.
When set to true, the script will print out more information about the script and the variables.
```bash
sudo bash install.sh --debug
# Example output
[DEBUG] Format type:  [DEBUG] Retrieved from config file:  format_type=btrfs
[DEBUG] Final value for:  format_type=btrfs
[DEBUG] Desktop environment:  [DEBUG] Retrieved from config file:  desktop_environment=gnome
[DEBUG] Final value for:  desktop_environment=gnome
[INFO] Starting stage:  1-pre
[INFO] Executing:  1-pre/pre-setup.sh
[DEBUG] Script path:  /home/ssnow/projects/arch-install/scripts/1-pre/pre-setup.sh
[DEBUG] DRY_RUN value before execution: true
```

### The install configuration file <arch_config.toml>
```bash
hostname = 'archlinux'
username = 'user'
password = 'changeme'
timezone = 'America/Toronto'
locale = 'en_US.UTF-8'
keyboard_layout = 'us'
keymap = 'en'
package_manager = 'paru'
bootloader = 'grub'
desktop_environment = 'gnome'
reflector_country = 'CA'
microcode = 'amd'
use_luks = false
luks_password = 'changeme'
install_device = 'nvme3n1'
partition1 = '/dev/nvme3n1p1'
partition2 = '/dev/nvme3n1p2'
partition3 = '/dev/nvme3n1p3'
shell = 'bash'
terminal = 'alacritty'
enable_ssh = true
format_type = 'btrfs'
sub_volumes = '@,@home,@var,@tmp,@.snapshots'
subvol_dir = 'boot/efi,home,.snapshots,var/{cache,var/log}'
device_type = 'ssd'
grub_theme = 'CyberRe'
load_themes = true


```

### Install script

- This script does the following:
1. It defines the path to the stages.toml file.
2. It includes a parse_stages_toml function that reads the TOML file and populates 
  the INSTALL_SCRIPTS associative array.
3. It calls parse_stages_toml to set up the installation stages and scripts.
4. It creates a sorted list of stages based on the keys in INSTALL_SCRIPTS.
5. It prints out the parsed stages and scripts for verification.
6. The main execution flow remains the same, using the parsed stages and scripts.

Ensure that the TOML file follows the expected format.
stages.toml
```shell
[stages]
"1-pre" = { mandatory = ["pre-setup.sh"], optional = ["run-checks.sh"] }
"2-drive" = { mandatory = ["partition-{format_type}.sh", "format-{format_type}.sh"] }
"3-base" = { mandatory = ["bootstrap-pkgs.sh", "generate-fstab.sh"] }
"4-post" = { mandatory = ["system-config.sh", "system-pkgs.sh"], optional = ["terminal.sh"] }
"5-desktop" = { mandatory = ["{desktop_environment}.sh"] }
"6-final" = { mandatory = ["last-cleanup.sh"] } 
"7-post-optional" = { optional = ["post-setup.sh"] }

[format_types]
btrfs = ["partition-btrfs.sh", "format-btrfs.sh"]
ext4 = ["partition-ext4.sh", "format-ext4.sh"]

[desktop_environments]
none = ["none.sh"]
gnome = ["gnome.sh"]
kde = ["kde.sh"]
cosmic = ["cosmic.sh"]
dwm = ["dwm.sh"]    
```

```shell
read_config
# Load configuration
load_config

check_required_scripts
process_installation_stages "$FORMAT_TYPE" "$DESKTOP_ENVIRONMENT" 

```

### Info tags
The info tags are used to print messages to the log file.
and also print to the console.
```shell
# LEVEL = [INFO, ACTION, DEBUG, ERROR, WARNING, OK, NOTE]
# MESSAGE = Main message

``` 
```bash
print_message PROC "Print configuration: ${YELLOW}Info:"

print_message INFO "Loading config for" "$var_name"
print_message ACTION "Would set $key=$value in $config_file" "(Config: $config_file)"
```
### Storing local variable.
variable is used to store the value of a variable. in the <arch_config.cfg> file.
```bash
# set_option "<KEY>" "<VARIABLE>"
set_option "BOOT_DEVICE" "/dev/disk/by-partlabel/BOOT"
```


### Loading configurations

1. load_config:
-  Takes multiple variable names as arguments.
-  Loads values for all specified variables from the config file.
-  Sets these values as global variables in the script.
-  Handles error checking for missing values.
-  Provides more detailed logging.

2. get_config_value:
-  Takes a single key as an argument.
-  Retrieves the value for that specific key from the config file or memory.
-  Returns the value (doesn't set global variables).
-  Handles default values.
-  Provides more granular control over retrieving individual values.
  
3. They serve different purposes and can be used in different scenarios:

- Use load_config when:
  - You need to load multiple configuration values at once.
  - You want these values to be set as global variables in your script.
  - You want automatic error handling for missing values.
- Use get_config_value when:
  - You need to retrieve a single configuration value.
  - You don't necessarily want to set a global variable.
  - You need more control over how the value is used or processed.
  - You want to provide a default value if the key is not found.
```shell
    # Load configuration
    local vars=(format_type desktop_environment)
    load_config "${vars[@]}" || { print_message ERROR "Failed to load config"; return 1; }
```

### Script logic <run_steps()>
implements the run_commands_with_messages function, the dry_run flag,
process_init. it also handle all the logging and error handling.
You can use this function to run multiple commands and messages.
There are other ways of using these functions.
You are limited to this template or you could add more to it.
```bash

--debug
--use-chroot
--critical
--error-handler
--success-handler
commands


```
```bash
example_function() {

    execute_process "Mirror setup" \
        --debug \
        #--use-chroot \ you can use chroot if you want to run the commands in a chroot environment.
        --error-message "Mirror setup failed" \
        --success-message "Mirror setup completed" \
        "curl -4 'https://ifconfig.co/country-iso' > COUNTRY_ISO" \
        "cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup"
}
```
There are other ways to use this function.
```bash

gpu_setup() {
    local gpu_info
    gpu_info=${GPU_DRIVER}

    case "$gpu_info" in
        *NVIDIA*|*GeForce*)
            print_message ACTION "Installing NVIDIA drivers"
            command="pacman -S --noconfirm --needed nvidia-dkms nvidia-utils lib32-nvidia-utils"
            ;;

        *)
            print_message WARNING "Unknown GPU. Installing generic drivers"
            command="pacman -S --noconfirm --needed xf86-video-vesa mesa"
            ;;
    esac
    print_message DEBUG "GPU type: ${gpu_info}"

}
```

## Package-manager

This tool is used to install, uninstall, and manage packages.
It will also generate a package list. from your current system as a master list.
this can be used to reinstall your system.
It can be used to install packages from the repo by categories: bin, aur and groups.
You can create your own package list.toml file. for different scenarios and your needs.
just follow the format.

```bash
# /scripts/0-tools/package_manager/package_manager.sh

```
### Checking updates
Create a list of packages to check for updates. so that this Only updates the list.
you can add or remove packages from the list.
You can also check for system-wide updates.
keep track of the updates.

```bash
# /scripts/0-tools/package-manager/check_update.sh
bash check_update.sh -h
Usage: check_update.sh [options] [package1] [package2] ...
Options:
  -h, --help     Show this help message
  -v, --verbose  Enable verbose output
  -s, --system   Check for system-wide updates
  -l, --log      Log output to file
  -u, --update   Update packages if available
  -f, --file     Specify a custom update list file (default: update_list.toml)
  -c, --create   Create a new update list file
  -a, --add      Add packages to the update list
  -r, --remove   Remove packages from the update list
If no packages are specified, only system-wide updates will be checked.
```
### Recovery
```bash
TODO this is a work in progress.
still in development.
```
